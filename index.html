     <hl>Transcription of William Knox 2nd Tract</hl>
     <p>    The British laws disown perpetual servi-</p>
     <p>tude, and the people of these islands have a</p>
     <p>general antipathy to slavery.  The right of</p>
     <p>the planter to his Negroe is only founded</p>
     <p>on the acts of his provincial assembly, and</p>
     <p>beyond their jurisdiction he has no power</p>
     <p>over him.  If he teaches his Negroe to read</p>
     <p>one book, he will of himself read another,</p>
     <p>and such has been the imprudence of some ill-</p>
     <p>informed writers, that books are not wanting</p>
     <p>to exhort the Negores to rebel against their</p>
     <p>masters.  Were the Negroes universally</p>
     <p>taught to read, and a late publication,* which</p>
     <p>out of respect I forbear to name, put into their</p>
     <p>hands and circulated among them, there would</p>
     <p>be little doubt that the next ships informed us</p>
     <p>of a general insurrection of the Negroes, and</p>
     <p>the massacre of their owners; and yet the</p>
     <p>writer's intention was certainly to engage the</p>
     <p>planter to have his Negroes instructed.</p>
